                            My name is Chief Daniel Osei. I was born on February 23 2005 and am now 16, My parents
                             come from Ghana but I was born in Germany. I began Kindergarten in Germany and did 2
                              years of school in Germany but then moved to Ghana and had a school there for 2 more
                               years before deciding it was too strict there and moved back to Germany. From there
                                on I continued my education in St.georges up until now and just finished my IGCSE exams. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On a different note, let's talk more about myself. I find myself to be a bit quiet around
                             people I don't know very well yet. This is mostly because I end up thinking too much about
                              what to say and how to format it in a way that doesn't hurt or offend anybody instead of
                               just saying my thoughts.

                            I tend to play Video games in my free time with some of my friends as
                             well as work out now every and then either on my own or with my track and
                              field club. I enjoy running a lot and usually take part in 60 or
                               100m races, though because of corona I haven't been able to properly
                                train anymore. My motivation for this has also decreased but I don't
                                 mind because programming is something I enjoy more and is what lead
                                  to creating this website

                            Additionally, I also take care of two ant colonies (lasius niger). I find
                             it fascinating watching their synchronized movements and such. I have kept
                              them from just two queens which altogether have probably already given
                               birth to over 200 workers, I would show pictures if I could. If you do
                                want pictures contact me
